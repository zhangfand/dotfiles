# A allowlist of folders to track for dotfiles.
#
# Here are some caveats of gitignore semantics:
# 
# Configure what gitignore file to use:
#  
# > dotfiles config --local core.excludesFile .gitignore_dotfiles
#
# Files in the ignored directory can't not be included again.
#
# Semantics of * 
# =========================
#
# An asterisk "*" matches anything except a slash. The character "?" matches
# any one character except "/". The range notation, e.g. [a-zA-Z], can be used
# to match one of the characters in a range. See fnmatch(3) and the
# FNM_PATHNAME flag for a more detailed description.
#
# Semantics of **
# =========================
#
# Two consecutive asterisks ("**") in patterns matched against full pathname
# may have special meaning:
# 
# A leading "**" followed by a slash means match in all directories. For
# example, "**/foo" matches file or directory "foo" anywhere, the same as
# pattern "foo". "**/foo/bar" matches file or directory "bar" anywhere that is
# directly under directory "foo".
# 
# A trailing "/**" matches everything inside. For example, "abc/**" matches all
# files inside directory "abc", relative to the location of the .gitignore
# file, with infinite depth.
# 
# A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches zero or
# more directories. For example, "a/**/b" matches "a/b", "a/x/b", "a/x/y/b" and
# so on.
# 
# Other consecutive asterisks are considered regular asterisks and will match
# according to the previous rules.
# 
# This command is handy to debug ignore files
# 
# > dotfiles check-ignore <path>
